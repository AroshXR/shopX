# Introduction

<p>In the Online E-Shopping Store, a variety of users interact with the system to
create a complete e-commerce experience. Visitors who have not yet registered
are known as unregistered customers. They can browse and search for products,
view item details, add items to the cart, and read reviews, but they must sign up
or log in to make purchases or manage their shopping activities. Once
registered, they become registered buyers, gaining access to a full set of features
such as managing their profiles, making payments, tracking orders, and
providing feedback through ratings and reviews.</p>

On the other side of the marketplace, sellers join the platform to offer their
products to buyers. These sellers can log in to manage their items, update offers,
and monitor payments received. To build greater trust with customers, sellers
can become verified sellers by undergoing an additional verification process
conducted by the system administrators. Verified sellers are granted access to
enhanced features such as managing their storefronts, advertising their products,
and subscribing to special membership tiers like Gold, Silver, or Bronze, which
offer different levels of exposure and benefits.

Supporting the shopping activities is the shopping cart system, which allows
buyers to add, view, and remove items conveniently before proceeding to
checkout. The entire purchasing process is backed by a secure payment system
that manages tasks such as validating card details, processing transactions,
issuing electronic receipts, and handling refunds if needed. Meanwhile, the
platform administrators, or admins, oversee the entire operation. They are
responsible for verifying sellers and products, managing users, and ensuring that
the platform remains trustworthy and efficient.
To complete the buyerâ€™s journey, the delivery manager play a crucial role by
managing the delivery process after an order is placed. They assign delivery
personnel, track the delivery progress, and update order statuses to ensure that
products reach buyers on time. Together, these actors create a seamless and
reliable e-shopping experience that connects buyers and sellers through a trusted
and efficient online marketplace.
